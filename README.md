# Rust

In the 'basic' folder, you will find the fundamentals of Rust programming language with examples to help you get started. Meanwhile, in the 'advanced' folder, I will be uploading more advanced Rust projects throughout this week.

## Installation and Configuration

To proceed with the project, it is recommended to have rust and cargo downloaded. You can download them from the following links:
- Download `rust` here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Download `cargo` here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have cloned the repository, you can execute the program by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cargo build
```
Remember that to deploy the contracts with `truffle`, you must use the following command in the terminal:
```sh
truffle migrate --network developer
```
After deploying the contracts, move the already deployed contracts to the no_migrate folder. To do this, simply drag and drop the files into the no_migrate folder or use the mv command in the terminal.

>*Remember to rename the example you want to execute to  `main.rs ` or add it to  `Cargo.toml `. *
