# Rust Blockchain

Here are more advanced projects with Rust. The blockchain implementation uses a simple proof-of-work algorithm to add new blocks to the chain. Each block in the chain contains a hash of the previous block, making it tamper-resistant. The project also includes a function to verify the validity of the blockchain, which checks that the hash of each block matches the previous block's hash.

## Installation and Configuration

To proceed with the project, it is recommended to have rust and cargo downloaded. You can download them from the following links:
- Download `rust` here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Download `cargo` here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have cloned the repository, you can execute the program by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cargo build
```
To run it, use
```sh
