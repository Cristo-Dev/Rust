# Rust Blockchain

In the 'basic' folder, you will find the fundamentals of Rust programming language with examples to help you get started. Meanwhile, in the 'advanced' folder, I will be uploading more advanced Rust projects throughout this week.

## Installation and Configuration

To proceed with the project, it is recommended to have rust and cargo downloaded. You can download them from the following links:
- Download `rust` here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Download `cargo` here: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Once you have cloned the repository, you can execute the program by running the following command in the terminal:

```sh
cargo build
```
To run it, use
```sh
cargo run
```
